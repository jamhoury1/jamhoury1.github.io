<tr><th>Abstract</th><td>This website explains to readers how organizations construct software to meet HIPAA security requirements. It explains the important cybersecurity features like, encryption, authentication, access control, security testing, and ongoing monitoirng. This is a great resource that emphasizes how secuirty must be built into systems from the start instead of being added afterward. Documentation, audits, employee training, and risk assessments help make sure there is long term compliance. It is a helpful guide that helps healthcare developers create secure systems to protect sensitive information in order to meet legal and ethical responsibilities.</td></tr>

<tr><th>Abstract</th><td>This IBM report provides readers with the data on how cybersecurity incidents may financially impact the healthcare sector. It explains the highest average cost breach usually goes to healthcare yearly rather than other industries. It highlights that strong cybersecuirty practices such as AI use, automations, and zero trust security models can all reduce not just the cost of an attack, but the duration as well. It explains that delayed responses, weak security controls, and outdated technology will increase damages. Investing in cybersecuirty will protect patient information better, improve response times when cyber attacks happen, and reduce the long term financial loss that affects the industry.</td></tr>
