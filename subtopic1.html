<tr><th>Abstract</th><td>The webpage is about how ransomware can severely affect healthcare systems. Ransomware is considered a serious cyber security threat. The website outlines what ransomware is, how cybercriminals can gain access to these symptoms, and what may happen when files are encrypted and inaccessible. It also explains how ransomware attacks actually become a HIPAA violation. This is because patient information becomes exposed or locked. It emphasizes that ransomware does not just disrupt technologu, but also delays medical treatment and operations which could cost a patient's life.
